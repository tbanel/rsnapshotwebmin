<header>Retain</header>

</p>
<p><strong>retain</strong>             [name]   [number]

</p>
<p>``name'' refers to the name of this backup level (e.g., hourly, daily,
so also called the 'interval'). ``number''
is the number of snapshots for this type of interval that will be retained.
The value of ``name'' will be the command passed to <strong>rsnapshot</strong> to perform
this type of backup.


</p>
<p>A deprecated alias for 'retain' is 'interval'.

</p>
<p>Example: <strong>retain hourly 6</strong>

</p>
<p>[root@localhost]# <strong>rsnapshot hourly</strong>

</p>
<p>For this example, every time this is run, the following will happen:

</p>
<p>&lt;snapshot_root&gt;/hourly.5/ will be deleted, if it exists.


</p>
<p>&lt;snapshot_root&gt;/hourly.{1,2,3,4} will all be rotated +1, if they exist.

</p>
<p>&lt;snapshot_root&gt;/hourly.0/ will be copied to &lt;snapshot_root&gt;/hourly.1/
using hard links.

</p>
<p>Each backup point (explained below) will then be rsynced to the
corresponding directories in &lt;snapshot_root&gt;/hourly.0/

</p>
<p>Backup levels must be specified in the config file in order, from most
frequent to least frequent. The first entry is the one which will be
synced with the backup points. The subsequent backup levels (e.g., daily,
weekly, etc) simply rotate, with each higher backup level pulling from the
one below it for its .0 directory.

</p>
<p>Example:

</p>

<p><strong>retain  hourly 6</strong>

</p>
<p><strong>retain  daily  7</strong>

</p>
<p><strong>retain  weekly 4</strong>

</p>
<p>daily.0/ will be copied from hourly.5/, and weekly.0/ will be copied from daily.6/

</p>
<p>hourly.0/ will be rsynced directly from the filesystem.
