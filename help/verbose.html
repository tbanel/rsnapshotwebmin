<header>Verbosity, Log Level, Log File</header>

<p><strong>verbose             2</strong>

</p>
<p>The amount of information to print out when the program is run. Allowed values
are 1 through 5. The default is 2.


</p>
<pre>
    1        Quiet            Show fatal errors only
    2        Default          Show warnings and errors
    3        Verbose          Show equivalent shell commands being executed
    4        Extra Verbose    Same as verbose, but with more detail
    5        Debug            All kinds of information

</pre>
<p><strong>loglevel            3</strong>

</p>
<p>This number means the same thing as <strong>verbose</strong> above, but it determines how
much data is written to the logfile, if one is being written.

</p>
<p>The only thing missing from this at the higher levels is the direct output
from rsync. We hope to add support for this in a future release.

</p>
<p><strong>logfile             /var/log/rsnapshot</strong>

</p>
<p>Full filesystem path to the rsnapshot log file. If this is defined, a log file
will be written, with the amount of data being controlled by <strong>loglevel</strong>. If
this is commented out, no log file will be written.
