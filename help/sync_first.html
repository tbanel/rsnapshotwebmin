<p><strong>sync_first          1</strong>

</p>
<p>sync_first changes the behaviour of rsnapshot. When this is enabled, all calls
to rsnapshot with various backup levels simply rotate files. All backups are handled
by calling rsnapshot with the ``sync'' argument. The synced files are stored in
a ``.sync'' directory under the snapshot_root.

</p>
<p>This allows better recovery in the event that rsnapshot is interrupted in the
middle of a sync operation, since the sync step and rotation steps are
separated. This also means that you can easily run ``rsnapshot sync'' on the
command line without fear of forcing all the other directories to rotate up.
This benefit comes at the cost of one more snapshot worth of disk space.
The default is 0 (off).
