<header>RSnapshot</header>
<p>
rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility. It can take incremental
snapshots of local and remote filesystems for any number of machines.

<p>
Local filesystem snapshots are handled with rsync(1). Secure remote
connections are handled with rsync over ssh(1), while anonymous rsync
connections simply use an rsync server. Both remote and local
transfers depend on rsync.

<p>
rsnapshot saves much more disk space than you might imagine. The
amount of space required is roughly the size of one full backup, plus
a copy of each additional file that is changed. rsnapshot makes
extensive use of hard links, so if the file doesn't change, the next
snapshot is simply a hard link to the exact same file.

<p>
rsnapshot will typically be invoked as root by a cron job, or series
of cron jobs. It is possible, however, to run as any arbitrary user
with an alternate configuration file.
