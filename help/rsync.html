<header>Rsync </header>

<p><strong>cmd_rsync</strong></p>
<p>
  Full path to rsync (required)

<p><strong>rsync_numtries</strong>
<p>
Number of rsync re-tries.
If you experience any network problems or
network card issues that tend to cause ssh to crap-out with
"Corrupted MAC on input" errors, for example, set this to a non-zero
value to have the rsync operation re-tried.

<p><strong>rsync_short_args    -a</strong>

</p>
<p>List of short arguments to pass to rsync. If not specified,
``-a'' is the default. Please note that these must be all next to each other.
For example, ``-az'' is valid, while ``-a -z'' is not.

</p>
<p>``-a'' is rsync's ``archive mode'' which tells it to copy as much of the
filesystem metadata as it can for each file.  This specifically does *not*
include information about hard links, as that would greatly increase rsync's
memory usage and slow it down.  If you need to preserve hard links in your
backups, then add ``H'' to this.

</p>
<p><strong>rsync_long_args     --delete --numeric-ids --relative --delete-excluded</strong>

</p>
<p>List of long arguments to pass to rsync.  The default values are
    --delete --numeric-ids --relative --delete-excluded
This means that the directory structure in each backup point destination 
will match that in the backup point source.

</p>
<p>Quotes are permitted in rsync_long_args, eg --rsync-path=``sudo /usr/bin/rsync''.
You may use either single (') or double (``) quotes, but nested quotes (including
mixed nested quotes) are not permitted.  Similar quoting is also allowed in
per-backup-point rsync_long_args.

<p><strong>link_dest           1</strong>

</p>
<p>If your version of rsync supports --link-dest (2.5.7 or newer), you can enable
this to let rsync handle some things that GNU cp or the built-in subroutines would
otherwise do. Enabling this makes rsnapshot take a slightly more complicated code
branch, but it's the best way to support special files on non-Linux systems.
