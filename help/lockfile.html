<p><strong>lockfile    /var/run/rsnapshot.pid</strong>

</p>
<p><strong>stop_on_stale_lockfile	0</strong>

</p>
<p>Lockfile to use when rsnapshot is run. This prevents a second invocation
from clobbering the first one. If not specified, no lock file is used.
Make sure to use a directory that is not world writeable for security
reasons.  Use of a lock file is strongly recommended.

</p>
<p>If a lockfile exists when rsnapshot starts, it will try to read the file
and stop with an error if it can't.  If it *can* read the file, it sees if
a process exists with the PID noted in the file.  If it does, rsnapshot
stops with an error message.  If there is no process with that PID, then
we assume that the lockfile is stale and ignore it *unless*
stop_on_stale_lockfile is set to 1 in which case we stop.

</p>
<p>stop_on_stale_lockfile defaults to 0.
