</p>
<p>Changes default behavior of rsnapshot and does not initially remove the 
oldest snapshot. Instead it moves that directory to _delete.[processid] and
continues as normal. Once the backup has been completed, the lockfile will
be removed before rsnapshot starts deleting the directory.

</p>
<p>Enabling this means that snapshots get taken sooner (since the delete doesn't
come first), and any other rsnapshot processes are allowed to start while the
final delete is happening. This benefit comes at the cost of using more
disk space. The default is 0 (off).

</p>
<p>The details of how this works have changed in rsnapshot version 1.3.1.
Originally you could only ever have one .delete directory per backup level.
Now you can have many, so if your next (eg) hourly backup kicks off while the
previous one is still doing a lazy delete you may temporarily have extra
_delete directories hanging around.
